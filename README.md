# final project for WMDD4935

## functionality

This is a Chat APP that allows users to ask questions. The APP would answer the questions and if there were any unknown questions, ChatME
will find answers based on Google search results. ChatME could also help users about the "weather", "time" and "music", and so on. The user
could also say that "it is boring" or "i want to play a game" and the APP provides a number guessing game to users. The user may try some
other questions, the APP may provide some interesting answers.

Kind reminder, please use lower case letters.
